    "# World Happiness Report - Data Analysis Project (Review)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this multi-day data analysis project! In this lab, you'll practice data analyst skills using the **World Happiness Report** dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness). You'll go through the entire data analysis workflow: loading the data, cleaning it, exploring it, analyzing correlations, visualizing results, and summarizing insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is designed for beginners, so we'll guide you with step-by-step instructions and hints. However, try to think critically and attempt each step on your own before revealing any provided solutions. The goal is to help you become comfortable with the data analysis process and with using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn."
